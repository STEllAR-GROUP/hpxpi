XPI Specification 0.9 rev74
---------------------------

General notes: 
    Many functions are documented as 'This (can be used) ...'. 
    Wouldn't it be more concise to use the function name instead of 'This'?

    The spec documents constructor functions for different types, but no 
    destructors. Why?

    All arguments for API functions should be const-correct.

3.3 High-Level Interface Routines

XPI_ABORT:
    Does the specification of XPI_abort belong into 3.2 instead?

4.2.2 Derived Types

XPI_TYPE_STRUCT: 
    'XPI_Type[n] types' instead of 'XPI_Type types[n]'

4.3 Parcel Continuations

XPI_CONTINUE: 
    'XPI_Type[n] types' instead of 'XPI_Type types[n]'

4.4 Parcel Generation

XPI_PARCEL_SET_DATA: 
    uses MPI_Type as argument

4.5 Apply

XPI_APPLY: 
    mistyped: XPI_err
    missing: parameter 'future'

4.6 Advanced

XPI_PARCEL_GET_CONT_ACTION:
    char** action: who is repsonsible for freeing the memory?

XPI_PARCEL_SELECT:
    Is this call blocking if no matching parcels are available?

XPI_PARCEL_GET_CONT_ACTION:
    char** action: who is repsonsible for freeing the memory?

XPI_PARCEL_GET_DATA_TYPE:
    XPI_Type* type: who is repsonsible for freeing the memory? If the caller 
                    is supposed to free the memory, how?

5.1 Address Space

XPI_NULL:
    does not make sense: "The NULL global virtual address is defined such that, 
                         when compared to an address initialized with the 
                         integer, 0."

5.2 Native Interface
